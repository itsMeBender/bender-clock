# A clock, one of many ...

I saw this nice [article on CSS clocks](https://cssanimation.rocks/clocks/), when I was looking for some ideas for my magic mirror project.  

For me it's a nice project to sharpen my skills in; CSS3, Javascript, units tests, Polymer, Web Componenets and Raspberry Pi projects.

## Why CSS

The clock is animated using **CSS3 transform properties**. This means optimal browser performance. JavaScript is only used to set the start time, dimensions and Polymer Web Components.
