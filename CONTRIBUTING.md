# Contributing

Hi, it's nice if you want to contribute to ththis project.  

Currently the impact of the project is small. I have one goal;

> Create an analog clock, based on CSS3 transform functions.  
> All combined into a nice Polymer element, to be reused in other projects.  

If you have other ideas, improvements, please add them.
